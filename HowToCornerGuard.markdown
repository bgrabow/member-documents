# How To Corner Guard

1. Your number one responsibility is to **keep the course free of obstructions and hazards**.
1. **You must be extra attentive** with the race on the square since there will be a lot more pedestrian traffic than on the Willy St Course.
1. **Always raise the flag** when the racers are approaching your location to alert both pedestrians and the next location.
1. **You are responsible for the safety of the race.**
1. The roads are closed by Police Order. **Be assertive but polite** to keep the racers safe at all times.
1. Pedestrians will not be accustomed to the speed and direction of the race but it is up to you to **tell pedestrians when they can safely cross the course**.
1. If someone complains, **apologize for any inconvenience** and give thanks for cooperation.
1. **Be viligant at all times**. Conditions will change every minute of the race. Kids, dogs, old people and cranky people may enter the course at any moment. Keep riders off the course unless they are racing or the course is open for warm-ups. Ask people to use sidewalks.
1. **Use your radio** if you see something unsafe on the course (like a crash) that affects the course. Identify the condition, your location, and the direction of the hazard (e.g. "Car leaving the course at crossing A" or "Riders down at Corner 1")
1. **Do a radio roll call before each race**. Before each race starts, there should be a roll call by location. The Onsite Coordinator will begin at Corner 1 and will go counter clock-wise around the course. All corner guards have responsibility for making sure everyone is at their locations.
1. **If a crash occurs at your location**, first warn other riders so the race passes without further incident. Then announce the accident by radio. If the course is obstructed, stand in the road and warn oncoming racers to slow.
1. **Use your radio** if you need help or have questions.
